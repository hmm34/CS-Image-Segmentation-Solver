CS-Image-Segmentation-Solver
============================

Project 1 for 3460:635 Advanced Algorithms.

### Project Description

The objective of this project is to implement the Ford-Fulkerson network flow algorithm and then use
it to solve an image segmentation problem. The image, stored in a plain pgm file, is split into two
parts (foreground and background) using the algorithm.
